## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I used a simple CSS grid for the main layout. Most of the text alignment was done with the `margin` property. One thing I was unsure about was how to change the image between desktop and mobile. In the process of doing research I came across the `<picture>` tag, which is nifty. Another interesting technique I came across was using `inline-flex` to center the button text.
